          No visual UI. No story. No personality. No presence.
          <br />
          Just GitHub code, often missed opportunities.
          <br />
          Lumina solves all these problems for developers:
          <br />
          1. Build a strong digital presence
          <br />
          2. Stand out in a crowded space
          <br />
          3. Unlock real opportunities
          <br />
          Because your skills deserve to be seen and remembered.
          <br />
          Build once, scale forever, and let people understand you at first glance.
